"""PanelScoringJob — swap in cross-sectional panel scores during inference.

Slots between CandidateJob (Phase 2) and RankingJob (Phase 3) of the
standard InferencePipeline. When the config flag
`ranking.panel_scoring.enabled` is true and a panel-LTR artifact is
configured, this Job loads the scorer, builds today's inference matrix
for every candidate ticker, and overwrites each CandidateResult's
`rank_score` in place. The existing RankingJob then blends that panel
score with rs_score using the same `ranking.blend_weights`.

Task chain::

    LoadScorerTask           read artifact path from config, cache scorer
    BuildFeatureMatrixTask   pick today's rows per candidate ticker
    ApplyScoresTask          write panel_score into CandidateResult.rank_score

The Job is a no-op when:
  • the config flag is off, OR
  • no candidates survived Phase 2 (ctx.candidates empty), OR
  • the artifact can't be loaded (logged, Job short-circuits).

Kept isolated from the Stage-1 training pipeline so revert is purely
additive: remove this file + the one-line import wiring.

        → LoadGlobalCalibration → ApplyGlobalCalibration (always-runs; see below)

    Ordering rationale (task #2, 2026-04-23):
      NGBoost runs BEFORE global calibration so that when NGBoost's
      score_mode == "mu_minus_lambda_sigma" it overwrites panel_score
      with μ−λσ, and the calibrator then maps μ−λσ → probability via its
      isotonic head. Previously calibration ran first and short-circuited
      in mu_minus_lambda_sigma mode, leaving rank_score as raw μ−λσ
      (always < 0.10 tier threshold → zero trades). With this ordering,
      both additive and mu_minus_lambda_sigma modes produce calibrated
      rank_score and the tier logic works in either.
